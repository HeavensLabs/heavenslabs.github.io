## Code of Conduct 📜
We follow a [Code of Conduct](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md) that outlines our expectations for participants in our community. Please read it before contributing to ensure a welcoming and positive environment for everyone.

## Getting Started 🚀
1. **Clone the Repository**: 
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/heavenslabs/website.git
   cd website
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies**: 
   - Make sure you have [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) installed, then run:
     ```bash
     npm install
     ```

3. **Start the Development Server**:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```
   - This will start a local server at `http://localhost:3000` where you can view your changes.

4. **Run Tests**:
   - If the project includes tests, run them to ensure your changes don’t break existing functionality:
     ```bash
     npm test
     ```

## Submitting a Contribution 📝
- **Pull Request Reviews**: Your pull request will be reviewed by one of our maintainers. They may ask you to make additional changes before it can be merged.
- **Merging**: Once your pull request is approved, a maintainer will merge it into the main branch. You may be asked to update your branch with the latest changes from the main branch before merging.

## Style Guide 🎨
- **Code Style**: Follow the existing coding style. Use consistent indentation, naming conventions, and formatting.
- **Commit Messages**: Write clear, concise commit messages. Use the present tense ("Add feature" not "Added feature") and capitalize the first letter of the message.
- **Comments**: Comment your code where necessary, especially for complex logic.
